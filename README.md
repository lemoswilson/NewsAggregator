## About

https://etuneapp1.herokuapp.com/

NewsAggregator is a full-stack web application that gathers news from electronic music related magazines/websites [__Resident Advisor__](https://ra.co), [__FactMagazine__](https://www.factmag.com/), [__Telekom Electronic Beats__](https://www.electronicbeats.net/) and [__Pitchfork__](https://pitchfork.com/). As of August 2021, the application is deprecated, the HTML layouts for the magazines websites has changed, and I decided not to update the app.
